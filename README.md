 My team's submission was awarded as the Champion for this competition, which was aimed at using the government's publicly available data at data.gov.my to address the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). <br><br>
 
Our app, Lestari ("Sustainable" in Malay), consists of 3 main modules:
1 - Lestari Kini -  Sustainable Analytics Dashboard to display Malaysia's rankings for each of the SDG and their various measurement KPIs.
2 - Lestari Bazaar - Sustainable Marketplace to allow SMEs to list their products. 
3 - Lestari Meter - Sustainable Business Analytics to measure each listing SME's scorecard to see what SDGs they are contributing to.

There is also a module showcasing each buyer's contribution towards each SDG in their own way. 
<br>Eg: RM 150 in purchase in companies that are contributing toward the SDG 1 - No Poverty will mean feeding 1 low income household for a month.

Our platform aims to connect government agencies and companies to sustainable SMEs to support them and purchase their services for events, functions, etc.
